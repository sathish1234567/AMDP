Note:
The above AMDP method is used just to read some data [OPTIONS READ-ONLY]. Lets add one more method where we can do change on DB record. 
Then for such a method OPTIONS READ-ONLY must not be specified.

 Important Points: 
 ____________________

1. Transaction control commands like COMMIT WORK /ROLLBACK WORK are not allowed inside AMDP method.

2. Update statement can not be performed on BUFFERED tables inside AMDP method.

3. AMDP are a part of native SQL and don't support automatic client handling.
